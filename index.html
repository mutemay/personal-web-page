        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="openingParagraph">Thank you for taking the time to visit my page. My name is Mute May and I am currently a freshman at MWSU, majoring in Computer Science, while double minoring in Math & Physics. I will be moving to San Francisco in September 2020. I am open to Front-End Development jobs. I have completed a few programming/development courses, as well as a full-stack bootcamp.</p>

          <h3>Hard Skills</h3>
          <span class="lineSpacing">
          <p>I've always been in love with technology since I was a kid, so it was an absolute joy to learn how to program. Through a diverse catalog of classes, online courses, and the occasional
          youtube video, I've built a proficient skill level in several languages including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and more.</p>

          <p>I'm a very hard worker. Work ethic has been a crucial component of my personality for as long as I can remember. One thing that sets me apart from my peers is my
          meticulous attention to detail - I'm a perfectionist to a tee. I strive for excellence in everything I do. Even though I'm competitive and always aim to be
           the most efficient person in the building, I also love to work in teams and to build relationships with my peers. I've learned so much from my fellow classmates over this past
          year and I'm confident the working environment will also serve as a field of learning. Not only do I want to build on the knowledge of my coworkers, I also want to
          spread what I know as well. </p>
